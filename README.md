A passionate **Full-stack Junior Web Developer** specialising in the front-end.

After working as a graphic designer in marketing agencies for 5 years, I spent 2 years at The University of Hong Kong as an IT officer, building websites and systems with well-designed UI. I enjoyed turning my designs into actual useable applications, so I decided to enhance my coding skills and even change my career to be a developer.

Having recently completed the intensive 16-week bootcamp at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), I have grown from an interested amateur coder into a competent and confident junior developer.

I am currently looking for a role where I can combine creativity with a super high level of technical knowledge and expand my knowledge in Full-Stack and Front-End development and design.

**Tech Skills** : Ruby, Rails HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, TailwindCSS, Express, Node.js, NextJS
