Seeking to pursue my passion for coding, I completed an intensive 16-week boot camp at Makers Academy, where I developed my coding skills and transformed into a competent and confident junior developer.

I am currently seeking a challenging role where I can combine my creativity with technical expertise in Full-Stack and Front-End development and design. I am eager to work with a team that values collaboration and innovation to create exceptional applications that make a difference in the industry.

## Skills

#### Passionate in design

As an experienced professional with a passion for creating beautiful layouts, I have spent over 6 years honing my skills in the design industry. Throughout my career, I have gained valuable experience and developed my skill set, transforming from a passionate graduate into a seasoned designer. I believe that my expertise in organizing elements to achieve aesthetically pleasing designs and my attention to detail will be an asset in a front-end development role.

#### Keen to details

As a designer and developer, I have always valued the importance of attention to detail. Whether it was creating marketing materials during my time in marketing agencies or developing programs during my studies at Makers, I have consistently demonstrated a commitment to achieving perfection by paying close attention to every detail. I believe that this level of detail-orientedness has been a key factor in my success thus far, and I look forward to applying this skill to future challenges.

#### Thrives under pressure

During my time working in marketing agencies, managing tight production timelines with multiple concurrent projects was standard practice. I impressed my team leaders with my ability to work efficiently under high pressure while maintaining a high standard of quality in my work.

#### Fast and motivated learner

During my academic and professional experience, I have demonstrated a keen ability to self-teach and learn new skills quickly. As an undergraduate student, I taught myself motion graphics and 3D animation from online resources in just three months, achieving an A grade for my final year project. Similarly, as an IT officer at The University of Hong Kong, I learned web development, including HTML, CSS, Javascript, and WordPress, from YouTube tutorials to fulfill my responsibilities effectively. I believe this ability to acquire new skills efficiently will enable me to make valuable contributions in any role I undertake.
