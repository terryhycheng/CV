As a **Junior Software Developer** with a background in graphic design and a recent graduate of Makers, a prestigious coding academy in London, I am equipped with the necessary technical skills and passion to develop visually appealing, user-friendly, and maintainable full-stack applications with high test coverage. My expertise in JavaScript, as well as its frameworks, such as MERN stack and NextJS, has enabled me to hone my skills in creating exceptional applications that meet the highest standards.

During my time at Makers, I gained extensive experience working in Agile teams, where I developed a deep understanding of critical application design patterns such as MVC and object-oriented design. This experience has given me a solid foundation in understanding the entire software development cycle, enabling me to work effectively with team members, and to deliver projects on time while maintaining quality standards.

Currently, I am seeking a challenging role where I can utilize my technical expertise in development and design to build exceptional applications that make a significant impact in the industry. I am enthusiastic about working with a team that values collaboration and innovation, and I am eager to learn new technologies and push the boundaries of what's possible in the field of software development.

## Skills

#### Passionate in design

As an experienced professional with a passion for creating beautiful layouts, I have spent over 6 years honing my skills in the design industry. Throughout my career, I have gained valuable experience and developed my skill set, transforming from a passionate graduate into a seasoned designer. I believe that my expertise in organizing elements to achieve aesthetically pleasing designs and my attention to detail will be an asset in a front-end development role.

#### Keen to details

As a designer and developer, I have always valued the importance of attention to detail. Whether it was creating marketing materials during my time in marketing agencies or developing programs during my studies at Makers, I have consistently demonstrated a commitment to achieving perfection by paying close attention to every detail. I believe that this level of detail-orientedness has been a key factor in my success thus far, and I look forward to applying this skill to future challenges.

#### Thrives under pressure

During my time working in marketing agencies, managing tight production timelines with multiple concurrent projects was standard practice. I impressed my team leaders with my ability to work efficiently under high pressure while maintaining a high standard of quality in my work.

#### Fast and motivated learner

During my academic and professional experience, I have demonstrated a keen ability to self-teach and learn new skills quickly. As an undergraduate student, I taught myself motion graphics and 3D animation from online resources in just three months, achieving an A grade for my final year project. Similarly, as an IT officer at The University of Hong Kong, I learned web development, including HTML, CSS, Javascript, and WordPress, from YouTube tutorials to fulfill my responsibilities effectively. I believe this ability to acquire new skills efficiently will enable me to make valuable contributions in any role I undertake.
